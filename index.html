			<p>During my solo travel adventure I was commonly approached with the questions, "where you from?" and "where you going", usually asked in succession. </p>
			<p>Beyond the literal meaning, there lay a realm of answers I had not yet discovered. Since then, I’ve been reflecting on my origin story, dreaming about the places I’d like to visit and gaining memorable travel experiences in between.</p>

			<p class="whereFrom1">Originally Sri Lankan, born in Dubai, raised in Toronto and proud to be Canadian. I don’t consider myself a passionate person but thinking about travel, art and food really excites me. Routine and comfort are important but experiencing challenges and being scared are equally imperative. I can thrive in a social environment but do equally well tucked away in seclusion with a good book or movie. Staying active is necessary which is why I run, spin, hike and rock climb.</p>
			<p>I quit my job once to travel to Nepal, India and Southeast Asia for a year. My solo adventure was one of my greatest achievements; from the basecamp of Mt. Everest to the ruins of Angkor Wat and from diving in Thailand to making Batik art in Bali with so much more cool stuff in between. My past has provided me with the courage to make change, a willingness to explore and a passion for learning and trying new things; these are the things that feed my lust for travel.</p>

					<p class="title">The historic route to the base of the world’s <em class="highest">highest</em> mountain has been drawing in thousands of trekkers for almost half a century. Winding through Sherpa villages and past monasteries, my journey started on a high note. From a distance, the peaks make for a silent and seductive backdrop. It was a magic show - a cloud would shift, the sky would open and a peak would materialize. We would stop and stare quizzically before it would vanish into the sky as quickly as it appeared. One village sold chocolate bars - the <strong>perfect</strong> treat after a cold, tiring day racked with altitude sickness. The Mars bar was rock hard and impossible to eat, so it remained in my armpit all night. The next morning I anxiously peeled back the wrapping. <span class="block">Still frozen</span>. It took three days and warmer altitude for it to get soft enough to eat. But it was a sweet reminder that no worthwhile experience can be rushed - <em>especially</em> on the roof of the world. </p>

					<p class="title">Here I was, within a great mass of pilgrims whose devotional will and purpose so strongly adhered to their own individuality. Although I didn’t share their reverence, I wanted to experience the uniqueness and importance of the ritual and most of all, in some way, try and feel like I belonged. I was participating in a practice rooted in such a rich history with people who appeared so pure and beautiful in their worship. I could hear God echoing in the long and dark corridors, I could see God in the transfixed eyes of the pilgrims, I could feel God in the cold water that poured over me, I could smell God in the air that filled with incense and flowers and I could taste God in the dampness of the aged stones of this ancient temple. And in the aftermath of this experience I had made a profound and personal realization that I wasn’t expecting would have revealed itself so clearly - if God means all these things to me, then I am at peace with my faith and its significance to me.</p>

					<p class="title">A 400m line had me bolting over luscious canopy and strangling me of the accompanying screaming. Then it happened again. This time our line ended at the window of a tree house, sitting comfortably thirty meters off the forest floor and in the middle of a gaping hole of heavy vegetation. I always fantasized about having a tree house when I was younger and now here I was; zipping in and out of one that was outfitted with a bathroom and running water. Wide-eyed and giddy with excitement, we committed ourselves to zipping circles around the tree house until nightfall. Spending our free time in a tree house was a different but equally rewarding experience. We ate meals that were made in a close by village and then zipped in, we shared exciting stories of our day and we got to know new friends. Still, my favourite moments took place in the morning. We would wake up in our sleeping bags and look out on to the vista as the rising sun shed light on all the fine details of the dense forest below us.</p>

					<p class="title">To realize the dream of seeing Angkor Wat by myself would have been an incredibly fulfilling experience. Sharing it with my father was the condensed milk in the proverbial cup of coffee (it’s how they commonly drink it in Southeast Asia). In our relentless effort to see it all, each day left us worn out. The remaining energy was spent dining at a local restaurant in Siem Reap, savouring an Amok dish (coconut based and delicious!) and $0.50 Angkor beers. Walking for most of the day in the relentless heat and climbing the tall stone steps to reach the landings of the temples was very challenging. Throughout the entire time we spent at Angkor, my father managed each challenge with incredible will and vigour, determined to admire every carving and pay homage to ancient Hindu aspirations that continue to influence and impress. I cherished his knowledge and passion for the living art and as we listened to the temples we heard our own heartbeats - two of the same, father and daughter, living out a dream.</p>

					<p class="title">Scuba diving had always been a fixture on my ever changing bucket list of life experiences. I knew many people who dove frequently and seeming to think that all their stories melded in to one, very common experience. This is probably why I never had any overzealous expectations of it.So I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived in Koh Tao and almost immediately took to it. After the third dive of my open-water course, I was completely hooked. It was a wonderful dive with good visibility and plenty of underwater life to admire. I surfaced with a broad smile knowing that I wanted make this part of my life. Koh Tao had an addictive vibe itself, being a laid back island that mainly attracted divers and tourists looking for a cheery but reflective atmosphere. I gave it a chance and found a passion for diving that flourished quite intensely and unexpectedly. It swept me off my feet and in to the colourful depths of the waters surrounding an island that will forever remain the setting for which I found a new, undying love.</p>

					<p class="title">“You will see the most beautiful scenery in all of Myanmar” is how a monk described the boat ride from Mwalymine to Hpa-An. I rode various buses for 18 hours in total and slept in a bus terminal overnight while wondering why I let a religious old man convince me of this ridiculous plan. When I finally laid my bag down and found a place to sit on the creaky, wooden floor of the boat (avoiding lurching nails and gaping holes), I somehow knew that this experience would be worth all the effort. During the 12 hour journey we stopped along the banks of villages, watching people and cargo embark and disembark using a makeshift ladder that was haphazardly anchored to the muddy slopes. As I watched the villagers waving from the shoreline and listening to the children next to me laugh happily, I realized how normal it had become to spend hours or days travelling to a place I had never intended on going to. I was travelling for travels sake; I travel to go, to move and to be moved and that, I decided, is why I did it.</p>

					<p class="title">My initial visits to the teashops in Malaysia always left me with the same impression. The stools and tables were unnecessarily miniature, the little tea cups always left me wanting more and the snacks were all profusely greasy. I more than often felt like an unwanted, foreign giant trying awkwardly to fit in. I had grown accustomed to this routine but every time I stepped into a teashop it was as if I was doing so for the first time. It took weeks before I gained the emotional security to finally relax and savour the moment. As part of the many revelations made on my trip, I started to realize that my journeys and experiences did not carry me far unless while it extended around me it also went an equal distance within my own world. I never would have imagined that the daily ritual of visiting a teashop would be a practice in strengthening my character, opening my heart and widening my perspectives. I didn’t have to go too far. I just had to learn how to sit down, enjoy every cup and watch the world go by.</p>

					<p class="title">I snapped a very large, waxy leaf off a branch and decided it would make do as a palette. I arranged the tubes of acrylic paint neatly in a row and propped up the canvas against one of the posts that held up the thatched roof above me. I sat down, crossed my legs and looked beyond the canvas to the rich paddy fields and the palm trees that hovered over them as they snaked off in to the distance. The smell of blooming flowers perfumed the air and the birds chirped as if to provide melody to this majestic setting. I was in the gardens of an art museum. Since I started my travels, I wrote daily to encapsulate all that I was feeling. Similarly, with every brush stroke, I was releasing an array of feelings - a neccessary catharsis. I walked back to my hostel that evening having felt like I had meditated for hours. The owner of the hostel noticed my disheveled appearance. “So, you’re an artist?”, he asked interested. I was flattered by this and responded candidly, “Not really - I’m just inspired”.</p>

			<p>The hazard of working as a designer for a travel company is that I'm always looking at beautiful images of destinations and discovering unique travel experiences. This helps continuously fuel my desire to travel and the list of places I'd like to visit. These are just a few ideas I've been lusting over lately: </p>

				<p>My trip as a single, female traveler was an exceptional learning experience and it taught me a lot about myself. I was continuously pushing my own boundaries and discovering strengths and weaknesses that I didn't know existed. Recently, I found a <a href="http://ryan.kohn.ca/">partner</a> to share my travels with. Traveling with a loved one presents unique challenges and reaps different but equally amazing rewards as traveling by myself. I look forward to all our future adventures together.</p>
